              <p>Morality is the foundation of mankind. To judge what is right and evil, what is good and death, is to live as a human. Through stories, all of us can travel back to witness the past and by stories we can shape the future. I dedicated my life for this task, that is to offer the best story my life can offer to all of you who will read me one day. Well, just wait for now, k?</p>
